Our client Jim had a desire to have an efficient and intuitive task manager that he would be able to use to schedule his work more effectively. Jim stated that his main criteria for his own ease of use was that the task manager should function almost exclusively with a command line interface. <br>

Therefore with this in mind our team designed this task manager, which we have named â€œThe Practical Task Managerâ€? or â€œTPTMâ€? for short. <br>

We believe that our program will be very beneficial to any user like Jim and are thus releasing it to the public to use free of charge (with permission given by our client). So, if you need a simple program to manage your busy life TPTM is the program for you!
