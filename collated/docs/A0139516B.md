> 2a1. System responds with an error message (e.g. "Invalid command format!")

> Use case resumes at step 1

2b. Actor enters in a task with the same name and details.

> 2b1. System displays an error message ("This task already exists in the task manager")

> Use case resumes at step 1

**MSS**

1. Actor requests the lists from the System.
2. System shows the task list.
3. Actor inputs the delete command of a task based on its index on the list.

5. System displays a feedback message that the task has been deleted, displayed list will be updated to reflect the new state.
7. Use case ends.

**Extensions**
